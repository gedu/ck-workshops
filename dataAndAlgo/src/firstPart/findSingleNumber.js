/**
 * You are given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except for one. 
 * Your task is to write a function that finds and returns the element that appears only once.
 * 
 * ### Function Signature
 * 
 * function findSingleNumber(nums)
 * 
 * ### Input
 * - nums: An array of integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears exactly once.
 * 
 * ### Output
 * - An integer representing the single element that appears only once in the input array.
 * 
 * ### Example
 * #### Input:
 * 
 * const nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2];
 * 
 * #### Output:
 * 
 * findSingleNumber2(nums);
 * // Output: 4
 * 
 * ### Explanation
 * 
 * In this example, all elements in the array [4, 1, 2, 1, 2] appear twice except for the number 4, 
 * which appears only once. 
 * The function should return 4 as it is the unique element in the array
